# oom-report
Summarize RAM consumption per process from syslog OOM reports by adding vm and rss columns.

```
Usage: perl oom_report.pl < file.txt
```
where file.txt contains an OOM listing extracted from /var/log/syslog. You must include the column header row. If you include a complete syslog file, it will find the first OOM.

# Example

Here's an example of running oom_report.pl on a 16 GB server:

```
$ perl oom_report.pl < myoom.txt

[..]
    salt-minion =         264,981
        dockerd =         297,009
docker-containe =         442,017
          agent =         584,720
          java3 =         877,946 (dd-agent)
          java1 =       1,205,023 (logstash)
          nginx =       2,926,052
          java2 =       5,608,659 (app server)

 total (vm+rss) =      13,427,264 KB
```
Example notes:

* 13 GB is accounted from 16 GB. Likely the remainder is used by the kernel itself.
* RAM is reported in KB.
* Current kernels kill the largest user of RAM by default, so in this case the process named java2.
